Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program
This repository contains a C++ program developed for the Corner Grocer to help them analyze daily sales records. The program reads item purchase data, calculates item frequencies, and provides a user-friendly interface to query and visualize this data.

Project Summary and Problem Solved
This project addresses the Corner Grocer's need to understand customer purchasing habits by analyzing text-based sales records. The primary problem solved is the efficient tracking and reporting of item purchase frequencies. By knowing how often specific items are bought, the grocer can optimize their store layout, particularly the produce section, to create a more effective and customer-friendly shopping experience. The program provides functionalities to look up individual item frequencies, list all item frequencies, and visualize these frequencies as a histogram, along with creating a backup data file.

What I Did Particularly Well
I believe I excelled in several key areas in this project:

Object-Oriented Design (OOD): I successfully implemented the core logic within a dedicated ItemTracker class, encapsulating data (itemFrequencies, file names) and behaviors (loading, counting, printing) into a cohesive unit. This adheres to modern C++ best practices and enhances code organization.

Effective Use of std::map: The choice and implementation of std::map proved highly effective for storing and efficiently retrieving item frequencies. Its automatic sorting of keys and fast lookup capabilities were perfectly suited for this task.

Robust File Handling: I ensured the program gracefully handles file operations, specifically checking if the input file can be opened and informing the user if an error occurs.

User-Friendly Interface: The menu-driven command-line interface is clear, intuitive, and guides the user through the program's functionalities effectively.

Automatic Backup File Creation: The frequency.dat backup file is created automatically upon program start, fulfilling a key requirement of the project without needing user intervention.

Input Validation: I implemented basic but effective input validation for menu choices, ensuring the program can handle incorrect user entries robustly.

Areas for Enhancement
While the program meets all specified requirements, there are areas where it could be further enhanced:

Case-Insensitivity for Item Lookup: Currently, the item lookup is case-sensitive (e.g., "apples" would not match "Apples"). Converting all items to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) during loading and for user input would make the lookup more robust and user-friendly. This would improve efficiency by preventing redundant entries and enhance security by ensuring all variations of an item are correctly counted.

Error Logging: Instead of just printing errors to std::cerr or exiting, a more sophisticated logging system (e.g., writing errors to a dedicated log file with timestamps) could be implemented. This would be invaluable for debugging in a production environment and provide an audit trail for program behavior, enhancing security.

Handling Large Datasets: For extremely large input files, loading all data into memory at once might become inefficient. An improvement could involve processing the file in chunks or using more advanced data streaming techniques to optimize memory usage and performance.

More Advanced User Interface: For a real-world application, a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using a library like Qt or SFML could significantly enhance the user experience.

Challenges and Overcoming Them
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring robust file input/output (I/O) and comprehensive error handling. Initially, I struggled with correctly identifying and handling scenarios where the input file might not exist or be accessible. I overcame this by:

Implementing explicit checks using if (!inputFile.is_open()) after attempting to open files.

Utilizing std::runtime_error to throw meaningful exceptions from private helper functions, which are then caught in the constructor for centralized error reporting and controlled program termination.

Careful use of std::cin.clear() and std::cin.ignore() in conjunction with a while loop for user input validation, preventing infinite loops caused by invalid input.

I've added cppreference.com to my support network as an invaluable resource for detailed documentation on C++ standard library components like std::map, std::ifstream, and std::cin manipulation. The Visual Studio debugger also became a crucial tool for tracing program execution and understanding the flow of data through the file I/O operations and map manipulations.

Transferable Skills
The skills gained from this project are highly transferable to other projects and coursework:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing, implementing, and utilizing classes with public and private members is a fundamental skill for larger, more complex software development.

Data Structures: Practical application of std::map for efficient data storage and retrieval is a core computer science concept applicable to many problem domains.

File Input/Output (I/O): The ability to read from and write to text files is essential for almost any application that needs to persist data.

Error Handling: Developing strategies to anticipate, detect, and respond to runtime errors and invalid user input is crucial for creating robust and reliable software.

Command-Line Interface (CLI) Design: Crafting clear, interactive menu-driven CLIs is a valuable skill for many utility programs and backend tools.

Problem Decomposition: Breaking down the overall problem into smaller, manageable functions and class methods.

Code Documentation and Readability: The practice of writing clean, well-commented code with consistent naming conventions is universally applicable and critical for collaborative development.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I focused on several aspects to ensure the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

Maintainability:

Modular Design: The use of the ItemTracker class encapsulates all related logic, meaning changes to how items are counted or printed are localized within this class, reducing the risk of unintended side effects elsewhere in the program.

Single Responsibility Principle: Each function (e.g., loadItemsFromFile, printHistogram) has a clear, single purpose, making it easier to understand, test, and modify independently.

Readability:

Descriptive Naming: Variables, functions, and the class itself have names that clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., itemFrequencies, getItemFrequency, backupFrequenciesToFile).

In-line Comments: Comments are strategically placed to explain complex logic, design decisions, and the purpose of different code blocks, aiding understanding for anyone reviewing the code.

Consistent Formatting: Adherence to standard C++ formatting (indentation, bracing style) makes the code visually consistent and easier to follow.

Adaptability:

Parameterized File Names: Input and output file names are passed as arguments to the ItemTracker constructor. This means the program can be easily reconfigured to work with different data files without requiring any code changes.

std::map Flexibility: std::map can handle any string as an item, making the program inherently adaptable to new or changing grocery item lists without code modification.

Clear Public Interface: The ItemTracker class's public methods provide a well-defined API. This allows for easy integration into larger systems or for future expansion, such as adding new reporting features, without altering the core data processing logic.
